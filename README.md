# hglock - Mercurial Lock Extension

This is the `hglock` extension, v0.5.4, retrieved from [pypi website](https://pypi.org/project/hglock/). Accordingly to the available information, this extension should be the one currently documentated in the [Mercurial Wiki](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/LockExtension) (and lost [thanks to Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket)) originally coded by [Martin Geisler](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/MartinGeisler).

Look at the `README` file for the original one from the package.
